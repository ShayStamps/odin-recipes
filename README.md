Pre test: 
Today I will be creating a recipe page using HTML. I will reflect on the project afterwards here in the description as a post.

Post test:
So I am now post, and I have updated the HTML and CSS to reflect a "prettier" version of my site. I think I did really well, even though I feel like I am winging it.
